# Military IDS (Intrusion Detection System)

This project is a **Python-based host IDS** that detects common reconnaissance
and attack patterns using live network traffic.

## 🚨 Detected Attacks

- Port Scanning (TCP based)
- SSH Brute-force Attempts

## 🧠 Detection Logic

- Uses time-window based behavioral analysis
- No payload inspection (works with encrypted traffic)
- Detects abnormal connection patterns
